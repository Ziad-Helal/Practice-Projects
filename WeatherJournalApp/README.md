# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
An asynchronous web app that uses Web API (of `http://openweathermap.org/`) and user data (`zip code`) to dynamically update the UI (viewing metric weather temperature of his location). 

## My Responsibilities
Using JavaScript only to implement `server.js` and `website/app.js`, so that the app performs exactly like described in the `Overview`.
